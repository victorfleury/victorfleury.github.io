<h4 id="long-story">Long story</h4>
<p>I have been working in the VFX industry for over 10 years now and as a software developer for almost 10 years.</p>
<p>I have always been interested in understanding how things work and to do so I really love to take them apart, and look under the hood.
So naturally when I first got my hands on a computer, I became fascinated by it and how I could create my own programs.
I have fond memories of taking apart my parents old computer and trying to rebuild it back from scratch, and trying to install any Linux distros I could get my hands on (which was quite a challenge back then, cause no high speed broadband &#x1f604; )</p>
<p>As long as I can remember, I have also been quite fond of cinema and VFX.
As cliche as it sounds I really loved growing up and watching <em>Star Wars</em>, <em>Back to the future</em>, <em>Indiana Jones</em>, <em>Jurassic Park</em> and a lot more, and I think it gave me the movie fever.</p>
<p>When graduating from high school, I started a degree in computer science. Learned a lot, but in the end the lack of creativity and cinema pushed me towards a second degree in arts and technology.</p>
<p>There I learned all I could about DCCs (Maya, Nuke, Houdini, etc&hellip;) and a bit of programming as well.</p>
